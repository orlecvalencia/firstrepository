Dear Miss Anne,

Thank you for applying for the Summer Interview Prep course. We have received and reviewed your application and the Admissions Team has concluded that we are unable to offer you acceptance for the course. As you may already know, the submission deadline has already ended two weeks ago and this year, we have received nearly 1500 applications making the competition keen and the classes already full.

Of course, we’d love to see you succeed so we won’t allow you to go without anything in your bag. CodePath has prepared an **[interview guide for Software Engineering Internships](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view)** which can help you ace your internship interviews. You are also invited to **[subscribe to our mailing list](https://codepath.com/subscribe)** so that you can be notified of our future courses and virtual events that you may be interested in.

We wish you much success in your future endeavors and appreciate your interest in CodePath.


Sincerely,

Orlec Valencia
CodePath Admissions Support
