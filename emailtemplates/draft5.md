Dear Ms. Maria,

Greetings from CodePath!

We recognize that you are checking on the status of your Tech Fellow application. We believe we submitted the application result two weeks ago, but just in case, we hate to notify you that your admissions application has not been approved at CodePath after carefully reviewing it. We value the time and energy you invested in submitting your application and we appreciate your interest in CodePath. The candidate pool for this year exceeded our expectations and our decision has been difficult due to the competition from qualified applicants. Although we would love to admit everyone who applies, there just isn't enough room.

On a more positive note, congrats on your academic success. We have faith that you'll succeed in all of your academic endeavors. Thank you for applying at CodePath, and we wish you the best success.


Sincerely,

Orlec Valencia
CodePath Admissions Support
