Dear Mr. Jose,

We appreciate you applying for admissions at CodePath. We apologize that we must deny your application at this time after analyzing your submission and the pre-work you supplied. The choice has been challenging, and even if your academic excellence cannot be denied, it is a condition that applicants should have a major/minor that is related to computer science, as indicated in the **[eligibility section](https://codepath.com/eligibility)** of the application.

Again, we congratulate you on your academic success. We have faith that you'll succeed in all of your academic endeavors. We appreciate your interest in CodePath and wish you luck with your applications.


Sincerely,

Orlec Valencia
CodePath Admissions Support
