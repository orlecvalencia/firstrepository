Dear Mr. Guru,

Greetings from CodePath!

One of your interviewees, Marie, has followed up on the results of the interview you have had with her yesterday. We understand your busy schedule and you might have just missed inputting Marieâ€™s interview results in our tracker. It would be great if the tracker can be updated the soonest possible time so we can immediately relay to Marie the conclusion of her Tech Fellow application.

In case you do not have it, here is the **[tracker for the interview results](https://codepath.come/trackerforinterview)**.

Please know that here at CodePath, all of your efforts are greatly appreciated.


Sincerely,

Orlec Valencia
CodePath Admissions Support
