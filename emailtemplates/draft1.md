Dear Miss Jane,

Thank you for your application for admission to CodePath. After reviewing your application and the pre-work sent, we regret that we must decline your application at this time. The decision has been difficult, and although you show outstanding potential as a student through the Flix app you have built, it is a requirement that applicants should be currently enrolled in the US, which is indicated in the **[eligibility section](https://www.codepath.com/eligibility)** during your filling out of the application.

CodePath has already run classes in other countries aside from the US, and there might be a possibility of expanding our courses to other countries, which updates you can find on the **[News page](https://www.codepath.com/newspage)** of our site.

We appreciate your consideration of CodePath along with the time and effort you have put into your application. We wish you the best of success in your academic endeavors. We encourage you to continue pursuing your academic goals.


Sincerely,

Orlec Valencia
CodePath Admissions Support
