Dear Mr. Dennis,

Thanks for getting in touch with CodePath regarding your Tech Fellow application. Rest assured that we have received and have already reviewed the application you have sent us last July 10. We are pleased to inform you that you satisfy all of the requirements we are looking for in a Tech Fellow but please know that prior to accepting you in our specialized training, there has to be at least one more eligible Tech Fellow from your school who completed their requirements as well. Please give us 5-7 more working days to review other applications from your school.

For the meantime, you may find **[here](https:/codepath.com/techfellow)** some information that you can find helpful when you are already in for the Tech Fellow training. Be in peace that your application is already in the pipeline.

Again, thank you for being actively engaged with your application and should you have other concerns, you may visit our **[Help Center](https:/codepath.com/helpcenter)**.


Sincerely,

Orlec Valencia
CodePath Admissions Support
